# food-search
This is a app made with Java, Maven, and Google APIs. Users can enter what type of food they want and the search radius they want to eat in, and the app will search for restaurants that match the user's desires. When the user selects a restaurant, they can view information about it, such as the address, open hours, and driving directions.
